Student Data Form (HTML + C++ + WAMP)

This project shows how an HTML form can take student details and pass them to a C++ program, which then stores the information in a text file. The form runs on the WAMP server, and the C++ executable handles file writing.

Project Files
StudentForm.html        – The student form displayed in the browser  
studenData.cpp          – C++ source code  
studenData.exe          – Compiled program used to save the data  
studentData.txt         – Output file where the data is stored  
README.md               – Project documentation

Purpose of the Project

The aim of this project is to demonstrate a simple workflow where user input from a web form is processed by a C++ program and saved to a text file. This is useful for beginners who want to understand how frontend input can be connected with backend logic using WAMP.

How to Run the Project
1. Install and Start WAMP

Download and install WAMP. Start the server and make sure it is running properly.

2. Place the Project in the WAMP Directory

Copy the entire project folder into:

C:\wamp64\www\FormSubmission_Project

3. Compile the C++ Program

Open a terminal in the project folder and compile the file:

g++ studenData.cpp -o studenData.exe


Ensure that the executable file is placed in the same directory as the HTML form.

4. Open the Form in the Browser

Run the following link in your browser:

http://localhost/FormSubmission_Project/StudentForm.html

5. Submit the Form

Fill out the student details in the form and submit it.
The WAMP server triggers the C++ executable, which receives the input and writes it into:

studentData.txt

How the System Works

The user fills out the form in the HTML page.

The form submission executes the C++ program.

The C++ program reads the provided values and writes them into a text file.

Notes

This is a simple demonstration project intended for learning purposes. It shows basic interaction between HTML, WAMP, and a C++ program.
